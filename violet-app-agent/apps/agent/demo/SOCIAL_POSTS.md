# Social Media Posts for Violet App Agent Demo

## Twitter/X Thread (Main Post)

### Tweet 1 (The Hook)
```
I typed one sentence.

47 seconds later, I had a deployed blog with:
- Cream backgrounds
- Georgia serif typography
- Teal/coral CTAs
- Working navigation

Here's how 👇
```

### Tweet 2 (The Input)
```
The entire prompt:

"Build me a blog called The Cosmic Observer about astronomy. Make a home page with a hero section."

That's it. No YAML. No configs. No boilerplate.
```

### Tweet 3 (The Tech)
```
Under the hood:

• LangGraph orchestrating specialized subagents
• Template Designer with verified Liquid tags (no hallucinated code)
• Rails runner for direct DB access
• 90s nostalgia CSS baked in

DHH would approve.
```

### Tweet 4 (The CTA)
```
Want to build something like this?

I'm judging the "Building with AI" track at the Violet Rails Hackathon.

Your challenge: Take this agent and make it do something we haven't thought of.

See you there.

One sentence. One deployed app.

I've been working on an AI agent that turns natural language descriptions into working Rails applications.

The result? Type "Build me a blog about astronomy" and get:
✓ A subdomain provisioned
✓ Styled pages with 90s nostalgia CSS
✓ Working navigation and forms
✓ Verified Liquid templates (no hallucinated code)

The secret sauce: A Template Designer subagent that only uses tags that actually exist in the framework. No runtime errors. No broken pages.

Tech stack:
• LangGraph for agent orchestration
• Specialized subagents for architecture, CMS, security
• Rails runner for direct database access
• Deterministic template system

I'm judging the "Building with AI" track at the upcoming Violet Rails Hackathon.

If you can extend this agent to do something unexpected - deploy a marketplace, generate a SaaS, build the next big thing - I want to see it.

## Reddit Post (r/rails, r/webdev, r/artificial)

**Title:** I built an AI agent that deploys Rails apps from natural language - 47 seconds from prompt to styled blog

**Body:**
```
Been working on this for a few weeks and wanted to share.

**The Problem:**
AI agents that generate code tend to hallucinate. They'll write Liquid tags that don't exist, causing runtime errors on pages they create.

**The Solution:**
A "Template Designer" subagent that:
1. Only uses verified Liquid tags from a whitelist
2. Generates styled HTML with CSS baked in (90s nostalgia aesthetic)
3. Verifies every page renders after creation

**Demo:**
Type: "Build me a blog called The Cosmic Observer about astronomy"
Get: A working subdomain with styled home page in under a minute

**Tech:**
- LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Specialized subagents (Architect, CMS Designer, Security, Deployer)
- Rails runner for direct database operations
- Deterministic template system

**Why I'm posting:**
I'm judging the "Building with AI" track at the Violet Rails Hackathon. Looking for people who want to extend this - deploy marketplaces, generate SaaS apps, whatever.

Code is open source: [GITHUB LINK]
Demo: [DEMO LINK]

Would love feedback from the Rails community.

## HN Post

**Title:** Show HN: AI agent that deploys Rails apps from natural language (no hallucinated code)

```
I built an AI agent that turns "Build me a blog about astronomy" into a deployed Rails app.

The key innovation: A "Template Designer" subagent that only uses verified Liquid tags. No hallucinated code = no runtime errors.

How it works:
1. You describe your app in plain English
2. Agent creates subdomain, generates styled pages, verifies they render
3. You get a working app with 90s nostalgia CSS (cream backgrounds, Georgia serif, teal/coral accents)

Under 1 minute from prompt to deployed app.

Tech: LangGraph, specialized subagents, Rails runner for DB access.

Open source. Looking for feedback and people who want to extend it.
