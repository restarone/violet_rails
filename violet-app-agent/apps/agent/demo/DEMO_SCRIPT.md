# Violet App Agent Demo Script

## The Hook (0-10 seconds)

**SHOW THE RESULT FIRST**

```
[Screen: The finished app - cosmic-observer.localhost:5250/home with 90s nostalgia styling]
```

**Voice:**
> "I typed one sentence. 47 seconds later, I had a deployed blog with this styling."

---

## The Problem (10-25 seconds)

**Voice:**
> "Building apps is slow. Even with Rails, you're still writing migrations,
> controllers, views, CSS... What if you could just describe what you want?"

```
[Screen: Split - left side shows traditional Rails workflow (terminal commands),
right side shows a text input box]
```

---

## The Demo (25-90 seconds)

### Step 1: Describe Your App

```
[Screen: Chat UI with user typing]
```

**Voice:**
> "Here's the entire prompt: 'Build me a blog called The Cosmic Observer about astronomy'"

**Type in the chat:**
```
Build me a blog called The Cosmic Observer about astronomy.
Make a home page with a hero section.
```

### Step 2: Watch It Build

```
[Screen: Show the streaming UI with tool calls appearing]
```

**Voice:**
> "The agent figures out what to build. Creates a subdomain.
> Generates styled pages. Verifies everything works."

**Show checkmarks appearing:**
- ✓ create_subdomain → cosmic-observer
- ✓ generate_styled_page → Home with 90s CSS
- ✓ create_page → /home
- ✓ verify_page → Success

### Step 3: The Result

```
[Screen: Navigate to cosmic-observer.localhost:5250/home]
```

**Voice:**
> "Cream backgrounds. Georgia serif. Teal and coral accents.
> This isn't generated garbage - it's designed."

---

## The Tech (90-120 seconds)

**Voice:**
> "Under the hood: LangGraph orchestrating specialized subagents.
> A Template Designer that only uses verified Liquid tags - no hallucinated code.
> Rails runner for direct database access. DHH would approve."

```

## The CTA (120-150 seconds)

```
[Screen: Hackathon landing page / graphic]
```

**Voice:**
> "Want to build something like this? I'm judging the 'Building with AI' track
> at the Violet Rails Hackathon.
>
> Your challenge: take this agent and make it do something we haven't thought of.
> Deploy a marketplace. Generate a SaaS. Build the next big thing.
>
> Link in description. See you there."

1. Terminal commands flying by (speed up)

3. Tool calls streaming in real-time
4. Before/after comparison (blank page → styled app)
